What I feel is that I have achieved an important goal, to land a steady job in my field. I still need to get used to it, once I do, I know that I have achieved another goal. Well, life is all about settings goals and working towards them. An environment like the standard office space is pretty rote and repetitive. </p>\n<p>I am in my young twenties, life has more to it than rote repetition inside a confined environment. Hold on I’m not complaining, but this life style gives me some free time to think and reflect. In the end I do want that comfortable life of settling down, starting a family and supporting them. At this moment I am still a baby in this game called life, there is still so much for me to experience outside of my circle.</p>\n<p>With this set schedule I have free time after work hours, therefore I can explore my hobbies and interests. This will expand my world and perspective as I meet people from different backgrounds but share a common interest like the hobby. I aim to expand my world even further, travelling, going through challenge, meeting people in all walks of life. Meeting people and seeing the world in another perspective is what any person should do.</p>\n<p>Alright, that is enough of my little speal. What’s next for me? Well I plan to continue doing what I’m doing, it’s going well so far. I am looking in the future to work in new geographical areas. I work in an industry where geography doesn’t bind me. To achieve this goal I work towards improving myself in all areas professionally. Therefore I will be able to take a job I want, anywhere in the world. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"repetitive-life"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
