It was actually a year where I started setting goals, I refer to them as goals, rather than resolutions. Because no one ever really follows through with ‘resolutions’ haha. </p>\n<p>Most of my goals were tangible, set them up in a SMART format. If you don’t know what SMART goals are, briefly, they are Specific, Measurable, Acheivable, Realistic, and Timely goals. Anyways I set some physical goals, academic goals, career goals, financial, relationship, personal and new activity type goals. I achieve a good amount of them. I won’t list them here, its more of my own personal thing. </p>\n<p>What I did find with myself was that I beat myself up for the goals I did not meet, and I dwelled on them for awhile. This was an unnecessary use of my time and energy. In return it set me back even further. From there I realized I know I have a crazy high expectation of myself, I’ll need to be aware of this more.</p>\n<p>Hmm if you guys don’t know how that feels like, I’ll make a relatable example. Say you really liked this girl, for awhile now and you finally mustered the courage to ask her out, or tell her how you feel. Then she rejects you, and you are young, you don’t know how to take rejection, so you dwell for a good couple days, weeks or months because you were so focused on this one object of your affection.</p>\n<p>Yea that was how I used to think, for sure my previous relationships. Current relationship goal, career goal, financial goals and other goals that I did not meet this year. </p>\n<p>Near the end of the year I did find something that worked in the favor for me. Hah, as soon as I started working at that <em>sexy</em> startup back in October, I was let go in December. Fuuuuuuuuck, what a set back. Well I would have thought like that if I was who I was last year, but this time it wasn’t a big deal, shit happens. Unfortunately it happens to a guy like me who already has to work twice as hard compared to everyone else, to get what he wants. I told myself, “Hey man, you’ve been through worse, you can pick yourself up from this.” and I did, the next day I was already searching actively for open positions and found some good leads. </p>\n<p>So the take home story of this experience was that for this last month of my 2017, although it was a shitty situation I learned how to handle it pretty well. I believe that this positive attitude despite negative cirucmstances and determination to succeed led to a pretty productive winter break. I do say that I like this way of focusing my energy into something useful.</p>\n<p>There you have it! It’s the start of my 2018 and its going well so far. I have continued some goals from 2017, and set some new ones for this 2018. This time around, if I dont achieve some of those goals I won’t beat myself up too hard. I can also take this new <em>fuck it</em> attitude and focus my energy and attention to things more worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Anyways, with my new found perspective let’s rock this 2018.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a-year-in-review"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
