Finally one of my favourite people has resurfaced. After going through and still working out his rough patches and recovery, the good Professor Jordan Peterson is back online with public interviews no doubt promoting his new book.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Order-More-Rules-Life/dp/0593084640\">Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life</a></p>\n<p>Having read his first book ‘12 Rules for Life’ and being a fan of his since I first was introduced to him around 2018, I pre-ordered a copy and once it arrived I binge read it and right now reading it over a second time. In these tough times we need him more than ever. I am personally glad that he’s back to articulate wisdom and timeless truths to us lost souls. By us I really mean personally to me.</p>\n<p>In the past couple months I’ve been conflicted. Which is why I am trying to work thorugh implementing the rules in this and his previous book, I’ll try to package up his overarching message. His teachings should help us understand a little bit of our humanity with the belief that we should always strive to be a little bit better and he is genuinely expressing himself.</p>\n<p>With most of his rules, I have them as a work in progress. Rule 11 of his second book: Do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant.</p>\n<p>Trying to work with that one right now! In my current state of affairs something is happening that I would interpret as a sleight against me and I’m trying so very hard not to see it in that way, but I can’t help but to feel it so. Especially that over the long period of time I let it happen unbeknowingly because of my ignorance. When I figured out the truth and what that meant for me, I confronted them and from their point of view they thought they were doing what was right at the time, going over their ideas and plans did they determine it was unfair to me. Yea, so I’m just going through that. They are trying to make amends but I see it as too late as I’ve already made up my mind to move on, but at the same time I should not hold anything against them and I am slowly trying to let things go. It’s almost very buddhist like as well. </p>\n<p>It’s also part of a point/rule of another book of tenets I’m trying to integrate as well: Don’t take anything personally and don’t take assumptions -> Two rules from “The Four Agreements” I think that is all pretty fitting.</p>\n<p>Like I was alluding to in the beginning it is easier said than done. So… yea that is what I’m going through and sorry for making this sound so vague, it’s a bit dull when I go through the details.</p>\n<p>For the most part it is just a recent example that I’m struggling with. Further demonstrating I’m just a human with flaws and pretty much found solace in Dr. Peterson’s work on a path of self discovery, introspection and wisdom.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"letting-go-of-resentment"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
