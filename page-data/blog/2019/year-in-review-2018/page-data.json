On top of setting goals I set out a general direction for myself. Reflecting over the year I can say I’m content, not yet truly accomplished and satisfied yet, but if I keep this consistency up each year in 5 to 10 years I will see noticeable positive improvements in all aspects of my life.</p>\n<p>I grew a lot, and this was all self-perpetuated. This is all thanks to my discovery of the Joe Rogan Podcast. It was something I left playing at work in my lull periods. His podcasts were captivating, having a range of guests from comedians, mma fighters, physicists, authors, philosophers, entrepreneurs, nutritionists and more. THe biggest influencers of my life were his guests: David Goggins, Sam Harris, Jocko Wilink, and my personal favourite, Jordan Peterson - A clinical psychologist and psychology professor from UofT who has recently come into fame and notoriety for reasons I can cover in a later post.</p>\n<p>Any these particular men have great content aside from the stupid uproar online. They are proponents of taking responsibility, working on yourself, motivating you to work hard, think critically, think for yourself, perserve through struggle, ultimately to make meaning for yourself.</p>\n<p>I was addicted to Joe’s podcast, I became even more addicted to Dr. Peterson’s material and lectures. I even bought some of his courses and book. I used Jordan Peterson’s lectures as a framework to guide myself down this path we call life.</p>\n<p>I found his 12 rules for life book particularly useful, and his self authoring program to set out goals, my fears, having that direction with goal setting, having something to concretely reflect on.</p>\n<p>Overall I would say with them as my role models I have had a solid year, I have accomplished most of my wishes I set out in 2018, only to be encounter myself in a small rut. Now I must define more goals, challenging ones to keep my engaged.</p>\n<p>Anyways, enough of that…</p>\n<p>Let’s start reflecting over my year! January 22, 2019 will mark my first full year of employment at a full time software development job right out of school! Hurrah! There are still many things for my to work on career wise, in terms of my technical skills: I have gained a solid base for full stack web development. I need to broaden my skillset, which I am setting out to do. To level up as a software engineer, one must broaden their skillset, have mastery over a certain set, or be able to take on and balance more responsibility… Hey, at least I know what I am lacking.</p>\n<p>Besides that I am happy to announce I have taken up new interests and hobbies, it has a good year as well in terms of work/life balance. Keeping up with my nutrition, fitness overall healthy lifestyle. Another thing I discovered from Joe’s podcasts: I was exposed to difference nutritionist, health experts. Which ultimately led me to experiment with the Keto diet and fasting. Thankfully it works well for me!</p>\n<p>Finances: well I am getting compensated alright, working in development is a good field. I will say I haven’t made this my primary focus, but I haven’t made rash decisions with my money that I regret. Other than spending on experiences… Like a trip around South East Asia! That experience was definitely worth it. Well, for next year I must be more conscious about it, saving more, earning more, having other modalities/sources of income, or taking a higher paying position.</p>\n<p>Personally I am becoming the man that I want to be, taking charge and taking full responsibility of himself. When I know I am at a certain degree of competence, I try to expand it more, this positive feedback loop affects other aspects of my life. I like it, I got to keep this up. Other good things have happened, I have had bad things happen too this year. Given how I am now and how I see things, I can pick myself up quickly.</p>\n<p>Continuing on. I think I matured alot over this past year, my behaviour is different from most 24 year old these days… Maybe that’s why I didn’t have too much problem in the dating scene ;) Oh yes, dating and relationships… well wouldn’t you like to know ;)</p>\n<p>I repeat myself, but hey.. It has been a solid year.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"year-in-review-2018"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
