As the dust settled in what were you going to do with the necessities in your life? Such as homeschooling children, potential job loss/income, adaptation to a working from home situation and venturing out of your home only for the bare essentials.</p>\n<p>Once that was all met we come to the realization that our lives were grounded.

If kettlebell (KB) swings are totally foreign to you, I suggest starting with <a href=\"https://el2.fourhourmail.com/c/xmu7md92v4h6hxoqv7hd/kkhmh6h9o6kll3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1wYk5DQy1CTU5LZw==\">this two-handed swing tutorial</a>. I also suggest starting with light weight. This exercise forces you to do counter-rotational work and is incredible for the core and posterior chain. Put more simply, KB swings hit just about everything besides your pectorals. Add some pushups to your routine_”</p>\n<p>Perform 3 sets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two handed swings - 20 reps</li>\n<li>20 Overhead halos - 20 reps, 10 per direction</li>\n<li>Chest hinges - 12 reps</li>\n<li>Kettle bell rows - 12 per side</li>\n<li>Shoulder Press - 10-12 per side</li>\n<li>Mid section around the world - 20 reps, 10 per direction</li>\n<li>Single arm swings - 20 reps</li>\n<li>Chest hinges - 12 reps</li>\n<li>Tricep Presses - 12-15 reps</li>\n<li>Shoulder cleans - 10 per side</li>\n<li>Figure Eights - 20 reps</li>\n<li>Chest hinges - 12 reps</li>\n<li>Two handed swings - 20 reps<br>\n*Substitute out the chest hinges for push-ups or Kettle Bell Squats</li>\n</ul>\n<p>End workout with 100 Two handed swings</p>\n<p>That’s all folks! I hope you have gained some perspective on fitting exercise into a home-living situation besides running and pushups and learned some new movements to add into existing routines as gyms have opened up.
