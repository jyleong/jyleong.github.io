To which he also played in a past life.</p>\n<p>After some inquisitive conversation he decided to get back into this game again. I suppose his intention was to play with others in said local gaming community. At the same time having an acquaintance to play with (me) readily.</p>\n<p>He researched all the games new features and evolution since he last left off before fully committing to buy the necessary things to get back into the game.</p>\n<p>This game was <a href=\"https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/\">Yu-Gi-Oh</a></p>\n<p>Yes you got that right, a children’s card game with complex features, rules and requires a bit of money to play. More fitting for an adult to grasp and afford.</p>\n<p>Where the scene can get competitive and competitive decks cost in the realm of thousands. Look at what topped in recent <a href=\"http://yugiohtopdecks.com/deck/8494\">events</a>!</p>\n<p>He did not want to test and play on a virtual simulator first. He enjoyed playing the game with real cards. I won’t knock him for that, it is pretty fun and engaging playing with a person sitting across from you.</p>\n<h5>Competing with minimalism:</h5>\n<p>As you may suspect it does go against the mantra of owning less things… The cards pile up the useful ones that we actually play with for competent decks, but also all the junk ones that are discarded or kept in storage somewhere.</p>\n<p>Recently, I am coming to the realization that minimalism is not about having the least amount of things as possible. It is about minimizing the amount of things that provide no extra value. Freeing time and space for the things that do provide value to our lives</p>\n<h5>How it was in the past:</h5>\n<p>In my process of decluttering last month I did do away with many of my toys and games. When it came to my box of Yu-Gi-Oh cards I did treat them the same… I suppose I always had a sense that I would return.</p>\n<p>I played form 2011-2012 and briefly again in 2018. In those periods I played virtually, carefully tested with cards until I was confident in making a single purchase of the ones I needed to construct a physical deck. After that more purchases happened in order to keep up/enhance what I had or to have new options to play with. At the time I was more of a player rather than a vendor, I had cards to trade and sell but did not. When I stopped playing I kept my cards. This is a vicious cycle.</p>\n<p>I had the most joy with the game in 2018 when a good old high school friend reconnected with me. Introduced me to more of his friends and we had grand times playing at each other’s countertops frequently.</p>\n<p>Most males do play games for a hobby. Many games do have high effort or high monetary costs that accumulate over time. Whether it is for leisure, achieving objectives or as a means to bond with others, most guys have an affinity for this activity.</p>\n<p>Personally I enjoyed video games and computer games in the past, but now as I spend many hours of my waking day in front of a computer screen already. The last thing I want to do is focus more in front of a screen at night. For a good period of time Yu-Gi-Oh was my vice.</p>\n<p>They were the best, calm and pleasant moments in that year. It dawned on me that even as a young person, we don’t need much to be entertained and happy.</p>\n<p>At summer’s end the three of them moved away for school and other ventures in their life. Our get togethers and game nights all came to an end.</p>\n<h5>The now with minimalism:</h5>\n<p>I do wish to play. The reason is that the hobby isn’t about collecting and owning cards for myself but it is a means to interact with others. I am more than happy that someone wants to play this game together again.</p>\n<p><em>There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with.</em> - Seneca</p>\n<p>Having the cards goes against the aspect of minimalism of owning less, however how I view this hobby of mine is a means to an end of experiences to share with others. Think of the games and fun times to be had with new friends and players in another community.</p>\n<p>It adds value in my life. The value of relationships and experiences. Those are very in line with the core tenants of minimalism.</p>\n<p>This time minimalism will affect my decision making:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resisting the temptation to buy and open new products - that is the way to accumulate more junk to declutter in the future</li>\n<li>Only buying individual cards that are absolutely necessary and sticking within a budget</li>\n<li>Checking if I possible have substitutes for the cards that I wanted or needed</li>\n<li>Be open to trading and selling my collection in order to get back initial investment on the cards</li>\n<li>Be aware of the space these cards actually take. When I am done playing they should be neatly put away</li>\n<li>Be aware of the “Keeping up with the Jones’” as I play with others and compare what I have with them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a link to a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/8fjqjx/how_can_you_be_a_minimalist_if_you_have_hobbies/\">reddit</a> post where OP had the same mental struggles.</p>\n<p><em>Now that I am starting to get back into this Yu-Gi-Oh backed with my philosophy and intentional living and spending</em>, <em>does anyone else play or want to join? Hit me up if you do!</em>  </p>\n<p><em>Otherwise, what are the hobbies and leisurely activities that make you go against minimalism?</em></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"hobbies_minimalism"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
