In these three months I had a drastic reduction in commuting related expenses. Transit pass? Unnecessary. Gas? Very little used as well - we only drove around for the bare necessities of grocery shopping in the early stages of quarantine (When the whole world wasn’t sure how crazy Covid-19 would be).</p>\n<p>In fact in this unprecedented situation it showed clear as day how little I needed to drive around or take public transit anywhere.</p>\n<p>I bought my used 2016 Toyota Corolla Sport edition in late ‘18 before I discovered the idea of <a href=\"https://pacedprogress.com/2020/01/decluttering/\">minimalism</a> and FIRE. This was a time very early on in my career of saving most of my money and not knowing what to do with it all. <strong><em>Doing what most Yappie millennials do, following what others say and do.</em></strong></p>\n<p>I purchased this in full by my parents suggestion and not thinking twice: “You should get a car! Everyone needs one, especially in this stage of life”. So at least since then I had the forethought of being careful with big purchases such as a vehicle.</p>\n<p>I did not finance a car. I had suspicions financing or leasing a middle class vehicle was a huge scam and only benefitted the dealer.</p>\n<p>It may be an S edition (For a slight cool sleek factor) but it is still a <strong>Toyota</strong>: I bought this for the sole purpose of its functionality <strong>Transport</strong>. This is also a vehicle that can last a long time. Our family’s Camry is still going strong despite being an ‘06 model.</p>\n<p>After a year and a half I only use it lightly, unfortunate to say. Especially in Covid times the family and I don’t go out as often. I know I will keep this vehicle and not think about purchasing any others for as long as we don’t find it necessary.</p>\n<p><em>After understanding minimalism and reflecting on my life style and preferences, I acknowledge that a car does not help me make or save money at all. Nor do I get joy with driving.</em></p>\n<p>In a sense I was “minimal” with its use, hah!</p>\n<p>To be pragmatic we will not be renewing the insurance of our other family vehicle after this is all over. Instead we go back to being a “1 car household” sharing the Corolla as we pair down.</p>\n<h3>Deliberate use and maintenance</h3>\n<p>As our province is moving towards its <a href=\"https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/phase-3\">reopening plan</a> it comes at a good time. For BC residents we are allowed to start summer travels within the province. I have a small road trip lined up over an extended weekend.</p>\n<p>It is a much needed break to get out of my city and home and live a little!</p>\n<p>This trip will take approximately 5 hours of road time. Again I don’t drive often, mainly for pleasure and light activities. It is a weekend vehicle with the partner and light errands. Over the course of this quarantine time even less so.</p>\n<p>I will concede that after over a year of usage I have not given my car its proper care. Although being a tech professional I am not a savvy car fella. I am confident that given the interest and effort I can be handy.</p>\n<p>Aside, it was long overdue time for some maintenance.</p>\n<p>Especially after inspecting my tires; One was nicked, but thankfully the incision was not deep enough to let out air. <em>However</em> the treads of all tires were worn out.</p>\n<p>The tires needed to be replaced, regardless of the pending trip. The oil and filter needed to be changed as well.</p>\n<p>After learning what I could about car maintenance I can change the oil and spare tires on my own, but still needed to get 4 new tires. We went to several service centres to get pricing estimate. Oh boy, wow, car parts and services are pretty expensive.</p>\n<p>The best deal I can get with included service would be approximately $200 per tire. The full service includes realignment, mounting the tires onto the rims. Which comes out to just under $1000 CAD, I am deciding to go with this because at this time I do not have all the equipment to manually remove and replace the tires onto the rims. In the future I must.</p>\n<p>Tell me, is that a good deal for servicing? I feel that the price for each new tire is fair, I am only eating the cost of servicing.</p>\n<p>I’ll have to regretfully fork this lump sum out… This is a lesson of the hidden costs of maintaining any sort of possessions. A core concept of minimalism is knowing what owning something means, in a sense <strong>they own you</strong>! Besides the upfront cost of purchasing some item, if we want to use them for a prolonged period of time, such as an important big purchase like a computer or car there are the ongoing but often ignored costs of maintenance and upkeep.</p>\n<p>For our circumstance, I am glad we are deciding to simplify our usage down one vehicle: To the newer and more reliable Corolla. This still justifies using <strong>A</strong> vehicle. The maintenance is much needed besides going on a trip.</p>\n<p>This will be a lingering through in my head for future anticipated large purchases…</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"car-ownership-costs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
