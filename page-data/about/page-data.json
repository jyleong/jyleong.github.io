Currently a software engineer living and working <em>remotely</em> in Vancouver. Outside of the standard Computer Science education I’ve received from <a href=\"https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html\">SFU</a>. I’ve found myself a peculiar position working with deskphone hardware reinventing common enterprise VoIP services at <a href=\"https://dialpad.com\">Dialpad</a>.</p>\n<p>I don’t want to be stereotyped as a socially inept code monkey, in fact I have many thoughts, questions and interests in multiple topics. Enough to justify sharing them under scrutiny using this little space on the internet.</p>\n<p>Here you’ll find a mix of entries cataloguing such as the learnings from coding, personal progress/achievements on other endeavors or thoughts and interpretations on philosophies and other topics that interest me.</p>\n<p>Particularly the ideas I resonate with are Stoicism, Buddhism and a personal growth/enlightenment mindset. Hence the self-labelled <em>Stoic Software Engineer</em>.</p>\n<p>Going by these practices I try to be a more intentional, insightful, introspective less shitty version of myself day by day.</p>\n<h3>Contact Me</h3>\n<p>If you’re a recruiter or just simply looking to connect I can be reached email at <a href=\"mailto:james.leong94@gmail.com\">james.leong94@gmail.com</a>! Or you can take a look at my <a href=\"/resume/\">resume</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we could work together! Discuss random ideas, ask questions around coding, Software Engineering or simply to connect. :)</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"about"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
