At least it was for me, while also still living at home during that period. It is great, but that does not mean I slack off after I came home from work. No no, I don’t remember the last time I used my precious spare time on something like binging TV extensively, playing video games, or just slothing abouts at home. I do that sometimes, but I don’t remember the last time when. I do have time for proper rest  which is enough and also not in excess.</p>\n<p>See, I’m still at a point in my life where I am still finding my place. During this time I have to make full use of my spare/free time and make sure every moment counts. Here I try to be most productive and do lots of things that I deem important, alot of that is to build my skills. Make myself a better engineer, man, w.e I decide I need to get better at.</p>\n<p>Aside from coding at work and as a hobby I am trying to gain some more real life skills that make me more worldy, adult, useful, wantable. Such as continuously reading, educating myself in other topics. I am quite surprised by the amount of books I have read in the past year. With reading I also try to pick up some skills to practice, from basic household chores, to improving my cooking skills, doing the type of blue collar stuff my family is able to do, training physically, or practicing and finding new hobbies or sports to do.</p>\n<p>In the end, keeping myself engaged like this is good. My mind is challenged in other aspects, it would prepared me say… If I were to go to school again, I think my brain would adjust well. Compared to the initial worries of their capabilities when others start back school after living life for a couple years.</p>\n<p>I’d like to say that I’m goal oriented, and I have many goals in different aspects of life: academic, career, relationship, skills-based, philosophical, spiritual, physical. I schedule those in to my everyday, everyweek life. </p>\n<p>Now I suppose this makes me seem very serious, I don’t doubt that I can be. However, I also value the important of my personal relationships and the quality time with my friends, family, loved ones. All in all life is a balance, and I am actively pursuing <em>my</em> balance.  </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"spare-time"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
