In fact I’ve only read through <em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius once very briefly.</p>\n<p>This book will be one of those with much re-readability. Where we learn more and more with each subsequent deeper reading.</p>\n<p><strong>I have not begun looking into Minimalism resources at all.</strong></p>\n<p>Nada, no books yet, not even blogs. I’ve only heard of the ideas from Youtube Channels like Matt D’avella. Its core idea sounds like something I have been practicing for most of my life.</p>\n<p>At least, in my head I am trying to be a more conscious consumer.</p>\n<p>So I do want to investigate into Minimalism much more before writing a full compare and contrast between the two philosophies/way of living.</p>\n<p>At first glance there should be similarities. Which is why they aren’t too hard for me to grasp and live by.</p>\n<p><strong>Similarities I can tell so far:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Practice of self-discipline/self-control over external desires</li>\n<li>Indifferent to our surroundings, able to see beyond external influences, good or bad</li>\n<li>Focusing on the present</li>\n<li>Meeting and fulfilling your actual needs</li>\n<li>Being happy and content with what we have</li>\n<li>Going against the norm in thinking</li>\n<li>Being more aware of our behaviours and actions</li>\n<li>Wealth lies in a calm state of mind, ie being free from distractions</li>\n<li>Believe in simplicity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Again, sorry for the word blob. As I grow in my knowledge and practice of these two subjects there will be a more in depth follow-up. Signing off for now : )</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"overlap-of-stoicism-and-minimalism"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2249152690","4044550207","63159454"]}
